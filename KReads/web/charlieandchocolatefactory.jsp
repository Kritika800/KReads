        <h3>Plot summary</h3>
        
        <p>
            Charlie Bucket lives in poverty with his parents and grandparents in a town which is home to a world-famous chocolate factory. One day, Charlie's bedridden<br> Grandpa Joe tells him about Willy Wonka, the factory's eccentric owner, and all of his fantastical candies. Rival chocolatiers sent in spies to steal his recipes,<br> forcing Wonka to close the factory and disappear. He reopened the factory years later, but the gates remain locked and nobody knows who is providing the factory with <br>its workforce.

The next day, the newspaper announces that Wonka has hidden five Golden Tickets in Wonka Bars; the finders of these tickets will be invited to come and tour the factory. <br>The first four tickets are found by gluttonous Augustus Gloop, spoiled Veruca Salt, gum-chewing Violet Beauregarde, and television addict Mike Teavee. One day, <br>Charlie buys a Wonka Bar with some money he found in the snow; the bar contains the fifth and final ticket. Upon hearing the news, Grandpa Joe regains his mobility and<br> volunteers to accompany Charlie to the factory.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the day of the tour, Wonka welcomes the five children and their parents inside the factory, a wonderland of confectionery creations that defy logic. They also<br> meet the Oompa-Loompas, a race of impish humanoids who help him operate the factory. During the tour, the other four children give in to their impulses and are<br> ejected from the tour in darkly comical ways: Augustus falls into the Chocolate River and is sucked up a pipe, Violet turns into a giant blueberry after chewing an <br>experimental stick of three-course dinner gum, Veruca and her parents fall down a garbage chute after the former tries to capture one of the nut-testing<br> squirrels, and Mike is shrunk down to the size of a chocolate bar after misusing the Television Chocolate device despite Wonka's warnings. The Oompa-Loompas sing about<br> the children's misbehaviour each time disaster strikes.</p>
        <p>
            With only Charlie remaining, Wonka congratulates him for "winning" the factory. Wonka explains that the whole tour was designed to help him find a worthy heir to<br> his business, and Charlie was the only child whose inherent genuineness passed the test. They ride the Great Glass Elevator and watch the other four children<br> leave the factory before flying to Charlie's house, where Wonka invites the entire Bucket clan to come and live with him in the factory.</p>
