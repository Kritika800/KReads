            <h3>Plot summary</h3>
            <p>The beautiful Venetia Lanyon, thanks to a reclusive and over-protective father, grew up in the country, away from the world with only her younger<br> brother Aubrey, bookish and lame, for company. Her peace and quiet is one day disturbed by the rakish Lord Damerel, who arrives to spend<br> time at his ancestral home next to the Lanyons' house. At first, she sensibly keeps away from him, but when Lord Damerel finds an injured<br> Aubrey and not only takes him into his home to recover but also treats him with great kindness and strikes up a friendship with the awkward<br> young man, she revises her first opinion of him and they soon become the best of friends.</p>
            <p>
               When Venetia and Lord Damerel fall in love, however, Damerel is convinced that marriage with him would cause Venetia's social ruin and insists that<br> it would be wrong to inflict this upon her. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When Venetia's older brother's wife and mother-in-law, about whom he had failed to inform the family, descend on the Lanyons, Venetia's domestic <br>situation becomes intolerable and she is invited to stay for a London season with her aunt and uncle as a way to escape the awkwardness and<br> also to find a husband. During this time, she discovers through a chance encounter that the mother she had been led to believe was dead <br>is actually very much alive and had simply left her father for another man when the children were very young. Venetia realises that this is <br>the cause of her relatives' over-protectiveness - they are concerned that she might follow in her mother's footsteps.
            </p>
            <p>
               Venetia, however, still very much loves Damerel and sets about creating her own happy ending, seeking the help of her disgraced and estranged mother <br>to persuade both her uncle and Damerel that the marriage should take place.
