    <p>
        The last four gnomes in Great Britain live beside Folly Brook in Warwickshire; they are named after the flowers Baldmoney, Sneezewort, Dodder <br>and Cloudberry. After Cloudberry goes exploring one day and does not return, the others make the tremendous decision to build a boat, the Dragonfly, and set out to find him. This is the story of the gnomes' epic journey, set against the background of the English countryside, beginning in spring, continuing through summer, and concluding in autumn, when the first frosts are starting to arrive.[6]

    <h3>Characters</h3>
    <h4>The Gnomes</h4>
    <p>
        Dodder is the oldest and grumpiest gnome, and the leader of the group. He is a skilled fisherman and has a leg made from bone as the result of an<br> attack by a fox.
Baldmoney acts as the navigator and mechanic on the gnomes' boat Jeanie Deans, and later invented a glider named Wonderbird.
Sneezewort is the youngest, most sensitive gnome who follows the lead of his older brothers and is usually assigned the less interesting tasks <br>such as cooking and cleaning.
Cloudberry is a boastful and rebellious loner who often leaves the group to explore the forest. He is on good terms with the greylag geese of Spitzbergen<br> known as the hounds of heaven.
    <h3>Supporting characters</h3>

The Farmer is Nanny Goat's owner. In Down The Bright Stream, Baldmoney uses his best Sunday shirt to build Wonderbird.<br>
Mr Shoebottom is an alcoholic petrol station owner who repairs the gnomes'<br> boat after it is discovered by his son.
Pan, the Greek guardian of nature, is the unseen deity who protects the gnomes<br> and forest animals, as in the Piper at the Gates of Dawn.

The "Chinaman" is an arrogant, brightly coloured cock pheasant who acts<br> as Giant Grum's lackey.
Red Robber is a greedy atheist fox who tries to eat Dodder, and does not <br>believe in Pan.
The Worm of Death is a treacherous, sadistic adder who preys upon defenceless <br>chicks in the second book.  
    </p>
    <h4>Sequels</h4>
    <h5>
        Down the Bright Stream
    </h5>
    <p>
       In the first sequel (published 1948), the four gnomes are forced to leave their home after it is damaged by flooding. <br>Using their clockwork boat the Jeanie Deans, and later a flying machine named Wonderbird, they travel to Ireland and colonise a ruined chapel <br>surrounded by a loch.[7] 
    </p>
    <h5>The Forest of Boland Light Railway</h5>
    <p>
     Years earlier, a community of gnomes in the Forest of Boland build a narrow gauge railway to transport their miners to the gold <br>mines and cope with the growing yields of ore. Some wicked goblins steal the steam locomotive named the Boland Belle, overrun the town <br>and enslave the population, but are eventually driven out of the forest by a friendly tribe of Cowzies.[8] The book's popularity among Generation X children in <br>the UK meant that it was reprinted twice, during the early 1970s and mid 1980s.[9]
