    <p>
        In Stockholm, journalist Mikael Blomkvist is recovering from the legal and professional fallout of a libel suit brought against him by <br>businessman Hans-Erik Wennerström. The wealthy Henrik Vanger offers Blomkvist evidence against Wennerström in exchange for an unusual task: <br>investigate the 40-year-old disappearance and presumed murder of Henrik's grandniece, 16-year-old Harriet.
        </p>
   
    <p>
        Every year, Vanger receives a framed pressed flower, the type she always gave him on his birthday. He believes her killer is taunting him. <br>Blomkvist moves into a cottage on the Vanger family estate on Hedestad Island and starts his investigation.

        Lisbeth Salander is an asocial investigator and hacker who is antagonized by her state-appointed guardian Nils Bjurman. Bjurman controls Salander's<br> finances and extorts sexual favors by threatening to have her institutionalized. In one meeting, Bjurman chains Salander to his bed and<br> brutally rapes her, unaware his action is recorded. At their next meeting, Salander tasers Bjurman, binds him, rapes him with a steel dildo, and tattoos<br> "I'm a rapist pig" across his chest. Using the recording she made, she blackmails him into giving her financial independence and ceasing <br>contact with her.

        Blomkvist explores the island and interviews Vanger's relatives, most of whom were Nazis and Nazi sympathizers during World War II. He uncovers a list<br> of names and numbers that are Bible verse references and recruits Salander as his research assistant. She discovers a connection between<br> the list and young women brutally murdered from 1947 to 1967, indicating a serial killer. Many of the victims have Jewish names, making her theorize that<br> the murders could have been motivated by antisemitism. One morning, Blomkvist finds the mutilated corpse of his cat on the doorstep.<br> Another night, a bullet grazes his forehead; after Salander tends to his wounds, they have sex. The pair learn that Harriet's late father,<br> Gottfried, and later Martin, her brother, committed the murders.
      </p>
   
    <p>
        While looking for more proof, Blomkvist gets caught by Martin, gassed unconscious, and restrained in a specially prepared basement. Martin brags about<br> killing and raping women for decades, like his father, but admits to not knowing what happened to Harriet. As Martin prepares to kill Blomkvist,<br> Salander arrives and wounds Martin, forcing him to flee. Pursued by Salander on her motorcycle, Martin runs his car off the road and hits a propane <br>tank, which blows up the car and kills him. As she nurses Blomkvist back to health, Salander reveals that she was institutionalized<br> after attempting to burn her father alive as a child.

         They deduce that Harriet is alive and in hiding; traveling to London, they find her. Harriet reveals that Gottfried sexually abused her when she was 14<br> for an entire year before she was able to defend herself, killing him in the process by drowning him. After witnessing the murder, Martin continued<br> to sexually abuse Harriet after Gottfried's death. Her cousin, Anita, smuggled her off the island and let Harriet assume her identity in London, <br>though Anita and her husband were later killed in a car accident. Finally free of her brother, Harriet returns to Sweden and tearfully<br> reunites with Henrik. 
      </p>

          Henrik gives Blomkvist the promised information against Wennerström, but it proves to be outdated and any statutes of limitations have run out. Salander <br>reveals that she has hacked Wennerström's accounts and discovered he is laundering money for various criminal syndicates. She gives Blomkvist<br> evidence of Wennerström's crimes, which Blomkvist publishes in a scathing editorial, ruining Wennerström and bringing Blomkvist to national prominence.<br> Salander, in disguise, travels to Switzerland and removes two billion euros from Wennerström's secret accounts. Wennerström is later<br> murdered in an apparent gangland shooting.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          On her way to give Blomkvist a Christmas present, Salander sees him and his lover, Erika Berger, being affectionate. She discards the gift and rides away <br>on her motorbike.
