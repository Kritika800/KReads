        Plot summary

Mr Darcy says Elizabeth is "not handsome enough to tempt him" to dance. (Artist: C.E. Brock, 1895)
In the early 19th century,<br> the Bennet family live at their Longbourn estate, situated near the village of Meryton in Hertfordshire, England. Mrs Bennet's greatest desire is to marry off<br> her five daughters to secure their futures.<br><br>

The arrival of Mr Bingley, a rich bachelor who rents the neighbouring Netherfield estate, gives her hope that one of her daughters might contract<br> an advantageous marriage, because "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife".<br><br>

At a ball, the family is introduced to the Netherfield party, including Mr Bingley, his two sisters and Mr Darcy, his dearest friend. Mr Bingley's <br>friendly and cheerful manner earns him popularity among the guests. He appears interested in Jane, the eldest Bennet daughter. Mr Darcy, reputed to be twice as wealthy as<br> Mr Bingley, is haughty and aloof,causing a decided dislike of him. <br><br>He declines to dance with Elizabeth, the second-eldest Bennet daughter, as she is "not handsome enough". <br>Although she jokes about it with her friend, Elizabeth is deeply offended.<br> Despite this first impression, Mr Darcy secretly begins to find himself drawn to Elizabeth as they continue to encounter each other at social events, <br>appreciating her wit and frankness.
