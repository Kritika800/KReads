    <p>
        The inhabitants of post-apocalypse Labrador have vague knowledge of the "Old People", a technologically advanced civilization they believe was destroyed when God sent <br>"Tribulation" to the world to punish their forebears' sins. The inhabitants practise a form of fundamentalist Christianity; they believe that to follow God's word and prevent<br> another Tribulation, they must preserve absolute normality among the surviving humans, plants and animals, and therefore practice eugenics. Humans with even<br> minor mutations are considered blasphemies and either killed or sterilized and banished to the Fringes, a lawless and untamed area rife with animal and plant mutations, and<br> suggested to be contaminated with radiation. Arguments occur over the keeping of a tailless cat or the possession of over-sized horses. These are deemed by the government <br>to be legitimate breeds, either existing before or achieved through conventional breeding. The government's position is considered both cynical and heretical <br>by many of the orthodox frontier community, and it is suggested that they support the usage of these animals for the sole purpose<br> of their greater efficiency.

        The inland rural settlement of Waknuk is a frontier farming community, populated with hardy and pious individuals, and is where the story mainly takes place. David Strorm, <br>the son of Waknuk's most religious man, Joseph Strorm, has dreams of large cities and "horseless carts", although he does not understand why he has these dreams or what they <br>mean, and is cautious about mentioning it to his father, lest he raise suspicion that he's a mutant. He makes friends with Sophie, a girl who secretly has <br>six toes on one of her feet. Later, Sophie's family attempts to escape from the reprisals (ceremonies in which blasphemies are sterilized) when her wet footprints are seen <br>and reported by a local boy.

    <p>
        David and a few other children in Waknuk hide their own form of mutation, telepathy. David's Uncle Axel, who learned about the group from talking to David about his telepathy<br> when he was young, advises David and protects them from persecution. He commends David on the wisdom of hiding his and the others' ability, and later kills the husband of <br>one of the group's members who was planning to blackmail the telepaths. David's younger sister Petra demonstrates exceptionally strong telepathic talent when<br> her horse is attacked by a wildcat—she calls to all the telepaths for help across the entire Waknuk area, and stuns those closest to her. That leads to suspicion from the<br> locals, and Uncle Axel warns the group, via David, that the Inspectors are beginning to investigate them.
        </p>
   
    
    <p>
        Later, two telepaths, Katherine and Sally, are captured and tortured for information, while David, his cousin Rosalind and Petra escape to the Fringes. A group of men from <br>various districts band together to track and capture the telepaths—unknown to the Norms, the posse includes a telepath named Michael who keeps the escaping group informed of <br>the trackers' progress. Later, with Petra's strong telepathic abilities, they contact a society with telepaths in a different country they mistakenly refer to<br> as "Sealand" (New Zealand). With the help of Sophie, who is now living in the Fringes, they escape the hunters and are rescued by a Sealand expedition. Unfortunately, they<br> do not have enough fuel to take the craft back to Waknuk to pick up Rachel, the lone remaining Waknuk telepath, so they continue to Sealand. Michael vows to return <br>to Waknuk to rescue Rachel, and join them in Sealand however they can.

        <h3>Tribulation</h3>
    <p>
        Though the nature of "Tribulation" is not explicitly stated, it is implied that it was a nuclear holocaust, both by the mutations and by the stories of sailors who report <br>blackened, glassy wastes to the south-west where the ruins of faintly glowing cities can be seen (presumably the east coast of the US). Sailors venturing too close to these <br>places experience symptoms consistent with radiation sickness. A woman from Sealand, a character with evident knowledge of the Old People's technology, mentions <br>"the power of gods in the hands of children", referring to the nuclear capabilities of world powers led by incompetent political leaders.
