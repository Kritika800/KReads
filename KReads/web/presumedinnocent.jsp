        <h3>Plot summary</h3>
    
        <p>
            Rozat "Rusty" Sabich is a prosecutor and the right-hand man of district attorney Raymond Horgan. When his colleague Carolyn Polhemus is found raped and murdered in her <br>apartment, Raymond insists that Rusty take charge of the investigation. With the election for District Attorney approaching, Tommy Molto, the acting head of the homicide <br>division, has left to join the rival campaign of Nico Della Guardia. Rusty, a married man, faces a conflict of interest since he had a brief sexual affair with Carolyn. <br>Rusty has since reconciled with his wife Barbara but is still obsessed with Carolyn.

            Detective Harold Greer is initially in charge of the murder investigation, but Rusty has him replaced with his friend Detective Dan Lipranzer, whom he persuades to narrow <br>the inquiry so that his relationship with Carolyn is left out. Raymond grows furious with Rusty's handling of the case, but admits that he had also been romantically <br>involved with Carolyn at one time. Rusty soon discovers that Molto is making his own inquiries. When Della Guardia wins the election, he and Molto accuse Rusty of the murder<br> and push to get evidence against him. Lipranzer is removed from the case, and Greer's inquiries uncover the affair.

            Rusty hires Sandy Stern, a top defense attorney. At trial, it is revealed that an important piece of evidence, a beer glass with Rustyâ€™s fingerprints, is missing. Raymond <br>testifies and perjures himself, claiming that Rusty insisted on handling the investigation. Rusty discovers that Carolyn had acquired a file for a bribery case involving <br>a man named Leon Wells. Upon being confronted by Rusty and Lipranzer, Wells confesses that he paid Judge Lyttle $1,500 to have criminal charges against him dropped, with <br>Carolyn acting as a facilitator.

            The thrust of Stern's defense is that Della Guardia and Molto have framed Rusty. During the cross-examination of the coroner, it is revealed that Carolyn underwent a tubal <br>ligation, thus having no reason to use the spermicidal contraceptive which was found on her. Stern asserts that the only explanation for this discrepancy is that the fluid <br>sample was not actually taken from Carolyn's body. Based on the disappearance of the beer glass, the lack of motive, and the fact that the fluid sample was rendered <br>meaningless, Judge Lyttle dismisses the charges. Rusty confronts Stern for bringing up the bribery file in the case. Stern reveals that Lyttle had a<br> brief sexual encounter with Carolyn and that he and Raymond knew that Lyttle was taking bribes, and although Lyttle had offered his resignation, Raymond felt that he was a brilliant<br> judge and deserved another chance. Lipranzer meets with Rusty and reveals the missing beer glass, explaining that he never returned it to evidence when the investigation was turned <br>over to Della Guardia and Molto. Rusty throws it into a river.

           Shortly after, at home, Rusty discovers a small hatchet with blood and hair on it. Barbara admits that she murdered Carolyn because of the affair. She expresses that she had<br> left enough evidence for Rusty to know that she committed the crime but did not anticipate him being charged. In a voice-over, Rusty explains that Carolyn's murder remains <br>unsolved as trying two people for the same crime is "a practical impossibility" and he could never take the mother away from his son even if it were possible to prosecute <br>her. Rusty states that there is a culprit and a punishment in this case, meaning he feels guilty because his actions led to Carolyn's death.
