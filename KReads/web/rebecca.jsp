        <h3>Plot summary</h3>
    
        <p>
            While working for Mrs. Van Hopper in Monte Carlo, a young woman becomes acquainted with Maxim de Winter, a recent widower. After a brief courtship, they become engaged.<br> They marry and then head to his mansion in England, Manderley.
            </p>
        <p>
            Mrs. de Winter meets Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper, who was devoted to his first wife Rebecca, who died in a boating accident. The staff and Maxim's friends also were fond<br> of Rebecca. Mrs. Danvers emphasizes the new Mrs. de Winter's inferiority in comparison. Jack Favell, Rebecca's cousin, comes to visit, saying that Mrs. Danvers invited him. <br>Learning of this infuriates Maxim, who banned him from the grounds, and accuses Mrs. de Winter of infidelity, which she denies. She confronts Mrs. Danvers for conspiring<br> against her by inviting Favell, demanding her resignation. Mrs. Danvers insists he was lying.
           </p>
        <P>
           The two begin working amicably together, with Mrs. Danvers assisting Mrs. de Winter in reviving the Manderley Costume Ball. Mrs. Danvers suggests that she choose a dress of a <br>de Winter ancestor. When she wears it, guests are shocked and Maxim is furious. Mrs. de Winter learns that Rebecca wore the dress the previous year.
        </P>
        
        <p>
            This reopens the investigation into Rebecca's death. Maxim confesses to his wife that his marriage to Rebecca was a sham and that he always hated her. He states she was cruel, <br>selfish, adulterous, and manipulative. On the night of her death, she told Maxim that she was pregnant with another man's child, which she would raise under the pretense <br>that it was Maxim's. She placed his gun to her chest and stated that the only way to be free of her was to kill her. Enraged, Maxim pulled the trigger, then disposed of <br>her body by placing it in her boat and sinking it.
            </p>
       <p>
           Though disturbed by his confession, Mrs. de Winter is relieved to know that Maxim loves her and resolves to support him during the investigation. Favell attempts to blackmail Maxim,<br> claiming to have proof that Rebecca did not intend suicide, in a note she had written.
           </p>
       <p>
           The trial shows Rebecca's boat to have been deliberately sunk. Testimony from Mrs. Danvers implies Rebecca's visit to a London doctor shortly before her death had to do with the <br>pregnancy. The prosecutor produces Maxim's cheque written to Favell for the note, and Favell accuses Maxim of murdering Rebecca. Maxim is placed under arrest.
       </p>
       
      
       <p>
           At Manderley, Mrs. Danvers reveals that Rebecca hated all the men in her life. Mrs. de Winter fires her, locates Rebecca's doctor and reads her file, which reveals that she could not<br> have been pregnant due to advanced uterine cancer and would have died within a few months. An investigator concludes Rebecca committed suicide by scuttling her<br> boat, while Mrs. de Winter privately concludes that she had wanted Maxim to kill her.
           </p>
       <p>
           Absolved, Maxim and his new wife drive home to find the mansion ablaze. A maid reveals that Mrs. Danvers started the fire and fled. Mrs. de Winter races to the cliffs, and finds her <br>standing on a precipice. She pleads with her not to jump, but the older woman curses the de Winters to never know happiness and jumps into the sea and drowns.
       </p>
       
       <p>
          Awakening from a dream years later, Mrs. de Winter is with her husband in Cairo, as they search for their dream home. She says that out of the wreck of Manderley she had saved the only <br>thing worth saving â€“ love.
