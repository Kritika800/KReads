        Sagan explains that science is not just a body of knowledge, but is a way of thinking. Sagan shows how scientific thinking is both imaginative and disciplined,<br> bringing humans to an understanding of how the universe is, rather than how they wish to perceive it. He says that science works much better than any other system <br> because it has a "built-in error-correcting machine".[2]: 27  Superstition and pseudoscience get in the way of the ability of many laypersons to appreciate the beauty <br> and benefits of science. Skeptical thinking allows people to construct, understand, reason, and recognize valid and invalid arguments. Wherever possible, <br> there must be independent validation of the concepts whose truth should be proved. He states that reason and logic would succeed once the truth were known.<br>  Conclusions emerge from premises, and the acceptability of the premises should not be discounted or accepted because of bias.

        <h3>Dragon in my garage</h3>
    <p>
        As an example of skeptical thinking, Sagan offers a story concerning a fire-breathing dragon who lives in his garage. When he persuades a rational, open-minded <br> visitor to meet the dragon, the visitor remarks that they are unable to see the creature. Sagan replies that he "neglected to mention that she's an invisible dragon".<br>  The visitor suggests spreading flour on the floor so that the creature's footprints might be seen, which Sagan says is a good idea, "but this dragon floats in the<br>  air". When the visitor considers using an infrared camera to view the creature's invisible fire, Sagan explains that her fire is heatless. He continues to<br>  counter every proposed physical test with a reason why the test will not work.
         </p>
    
    

    <p>
        Sagan concludes by asking: "Now what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all? If there's no <br> way to disprove my contention, no conceivable experiment that would count against it, what does it mean to say that my dragon exists? Your inability to invalidate<br>  my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true."

    <p>
        Continuing with concepts relevant to the 'dragon in my garage' story, Sagan writes about a patient of John Mack who claimed to have scars on her body which were from<br>  encounters with aliens. Sagan writes that if the patient is asked what her scars look like, she is unable to show them because, unfortunately, they are located in<br>  the private areas of her body.
