        <h3>Plot summary</h3>
        
        <p>The book is a first-person narrative in which Mildred Lathbury records the humdrum details of her everyday life in post-war London near the start<br> of the 1950s. Perpetually self-deprecating, but with the sharpest wit, Mildred is a clergyman’s daughter who is now just over thirty and lives in "a <br>shabby part…very much the 'wrong' side of Victoria Station". She works part-time at the charitable Society for Aged Gentlewomen and otherwise occupies <br>herself by attending and helping at the local church. There she is particularly friendly with its unmarried High church priest Julian Malory and his slightly <br>older sister Winifred, who keeps house for him.

Recently Mildred had shared a flat with her schoolteacher friend Dora Caldicote and at one time had been briefly courted by Dora's brother William, with whom<br> she still occasionally keeps in touch. Her rather uneventful life grows more exciting with the arrival of new neighbours in the flat below her, <br>anthropologist Helena Napier and her handsome husband Rocky, to whom Mildred feels herself drawn. However, she is wary of being too taken in by his charm, <br>having learned that while serving in Italy in the Royal Navy , Rocky's principal task had been to look after<br> the welfare of the female auxiliaries known as 'Wrens'.

            Helena is not interested in housework and leaves the flat in an untidy state. After his return, Rocky is only a little more house-proud, preferring<br> to go up to Mildred's flat and get her to make him tea. Eventually the ill-matched married couple quarrel when Helena leaves a hot saucepan on a <br>polished walnut table; she storms off to live with her mother and he to stay in a country cottage he owns. Mildred is left to negotiate between them who <br>owns what furniture and eventually helps arrange their reconciliation.

A subplot revolves around the activities of Julian Malory, who accepts Allegra Gray, a glamorous clergyman's widow, as a tenant for the flat in his vicarage. After<br> Julian eventually becomes engaged to Allegra, she attempts to ease Julian's sister out of the house. Winifred then flees weeping to Mildred and <br>asks if she can stay with her. Julian follows her closely, having quarrelled with Allegra over her behaviour. The engagement is broken off and Allegra <br>leaves for the more upmarket area of Kensington. Winifred confesses that she had always hoped that Mildred would marry Julian so that they could all live <br>together, but obviously that has now become impossible.

            Throughout these events, Mildred wryly observes the ups and downs of matrimony, offering a ready ear to the participants and wondering whether she would<br> be happy left completely on the shelf. When attending a meeting of Helena Napier's 'Learned Society' (which is never specified), Mildred had met<br> Helena's supposed alternative love interest, fellow anthropologist Everard Bone, who is definitely wary of becoming entangled with a married woman and<br> at one point flees to the north to pursue his interest in prehistory. Subsequently he seems more impressed by Mildred than she is by him as he pursues her<br> with phone calls and invitations to dinner. By the end of the novel, however, Mildred reluctantly agrees to play the <br>'excellent woman' in Everard’s life, to the extent of proof-reading his learned papers and helping index them.
